Knowing that our daily digital interactions have a vital impact on our culture and society is the driving force behind my passion for creating multimedia.

​<br>
I aim to help people and their companies grow with my skills in producing and designing marketing materials. I studied Cinema and Digital Media, and Economics (with an emphasis in Data Analytics) at the University of California, Davis before moving back home to San Diego. With my creative and analytical background, I have the tools to build brands and companies, and distill meaning from a pile of data
