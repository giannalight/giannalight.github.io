<h3>Play Time</h3>
<b>My Role</b>: Sound designer and voice actor
<br> 
<br> 
This was a collaboration piece where my two partners and I read and interpreted a short story, "Playtime", then designed and edited an audio track for it. All of the atmosphere, Foley sounds, and dialogue were recorded by us. After finishing our soundtrack, three other inspired individuals then took our audio and produced a video to go along with it.
